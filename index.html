                <h4>New 1969-70 Ford Mustang Mach 1, Boss 302 and Boss 429 now on sale</h4>
                <p>Ford has a new Mach 1 in the works.
                <br>
                    <br>
                    It’s not a Mustang, but an all-electric performance utility vehicle that it plans to unveil in a couple of years.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If that’s not your thing, don’t worry, because now you can buy a brand new version of the original Mustang Mach 1.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At least the closest thing to it.

                <p>If you walk into a Ford dealer today, you can pick up a 2018 Mustang GT that makes 460 hp, hits 60 mph in 4.4 seconds, and includes an optional magnetic suspension for less than $45,000. It will be comfortable and refined enough to take on a road trip, while still keeping up with the pricier BMW M4 on the track.</p>

                <p>But no matter how good the current car is, there's always going to be a certain group of people who wish Ford would simply keep building vintage Mustangs. That's where continuation builders such as Classic Recreations come in.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Classic Recreations has been building officially licensed Shelby Mustangs for a while, and according to our friends at AUTOMOBILE, they're good. Really good. Recently, CR landed the license to build three more classic Mustangs: the 1969-1970 Boss 302, the 1969-1970 Boss 429, and the 1969-1970 Mach 1. These aren't resto-mods, either. Underneath the vintage sheetmetal, you essentially get a brand new car.</p>

            <h4>Combo Platter: Jim Weigle’s 1969/2014 Mustang is an exercise in mating old and new to create one amazing Mustang</h4>
            <p>When we first walked up to Jim Weigle’s all-black 1969 Mustang SportsRoof at the Carlisle Ford Nationals in 2017, it got our attention because it was straight as an arrow and with paint as deep as the ocean. </p>

                <p>Then we looked under the hood; “Nice, four-cam Cobra motor swap and it looks factory.” As we soon found out, it was. So What?</p>
                <div class="plater-inf2">
                    <p>That engine wasn’t even a dream in any engineers’ eyes in 1969. The deeper we looked, the more it became obvious what we were looking at. Jim very skillfully mated the 1969 body to the complete chassis and running gear of a 2014 Shelby GT500, complete with the full 2014 interior, accessories, and even fuel filler. And a few bug guts in the grille proved he drove it to Carlisle from his home in Parkersburg, West Virginia. </p>
